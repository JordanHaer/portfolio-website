    "description": "Developed our internal iOS desk booking app using Swift and SwiftUI with the MVVM + clean architecture. Leveraging the Microsoft Authentication Library, I implemented SSO with mkodo domain emails and MFA to enhance security and user experience. To achieve a seamless navigation experience, I harnessed Apple's NavigationStack API and built a custom session manager. Moreover, I took charge of setting up Jenkins pipelines for streamlined CI/CD processes, contributing to an efficient development workflow.",
