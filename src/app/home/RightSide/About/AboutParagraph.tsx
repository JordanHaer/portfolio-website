        When learning to code I was quickly overwhelmed by the amount of information available online. To get
        started, I followed the recommendations of various sources and enrolled in Harvard&apos;s online CS50
        course, specifically their Python program. This experience allowed me to grasp the fundamentals of
        programming such as data structures and object-oriented programming.

        Wanting to build upon the solid foundation I gained from completing the CS50 Python course and create more
        advanced applications I enrolled in a full-stack developer bootcamp. Once learning the Web fundementals
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I delved into the MERN stack.

        Applying my newfound knowledge, I built a practice stock trading platform called MockStocks. This project
        allowed me to enhance my skills in system design, develop robust back-end systems, implement secure user
        authentication, and design intuitive front-end interfaces.

        Continuously learning and staying updated with new tools, technologies, and concepts is an integral part of
        my journey as a developer, I have recently learnt Next.js as well as TypeScript. I am committed to
        expanding my knowledge base and embracing the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
