### Introduction

Learning HTML is often the starting point for everyone's web development journey. From the initial steps of understanding tags and elements to exploring more advanced areas such as forms, I've come to appreciate the incredible capabilities of HTML in building web pages. Like any new language, we begin with "Hello World" as a foundational example.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Getting Started: Embracing the Basics

When I began my learning HTML I familiarised myself with the fundamental tags, elements, and attributes, realising how they work together to structure and define the content of web pages. As I experimented with various tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<img>`, using the live server extension I could see the page change as I edited my code which was a rewarding experience.

### Building Blocks of Structure: Semantics and Organization

One aspect that stood out to me was the significance of semantic HTML. I realised that using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` not only enhanced the structure of my web pages but also improved accessibility and search engine optimisation. By embracing semantic HTML, I could express the purpose and meaning of different sections within my content, making it more meaningful to the browser and more understandable to me when editing my code.

### Conclusion

Learning HTML has provided me with a solid foundation for web development. From understanding the basics of tags and elements to exploring semantic HTML, I've gained invaluable insights. HTML has taught me the importance of clean well structed code.
